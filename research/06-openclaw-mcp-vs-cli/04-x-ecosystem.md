## ECOSYSTEM GROWTH SIGNALS

## ⚠️ CRITICISM & PAIN POINTS

1. **Context Window Tax** (dominant critique):
   - @chrysb: "connect 10 servers with 5 tools each and..."
   - @taayjuss: "50 tool definitions loaded before you even do anything"
   - @Mattmaximo: "you'll chew up a shitload of context just loading the MCP server"

2. **Setup Complexity:**
   - @nimsfitt: "Google launched it, but it's difficult to set up... Cursor is far easier"

3. **MCP vs. Native Integration:**
   - @jpakjr: "even if there is a good mcp, the provider will just make a native tool"
   - @habibislop: "if agents can read your docs why exactly do we need to build/host an entire MCP server?"

4. **Cloudflare's response:** "Code mode" = 99.9% token reduction, positioned as the answer to bloat.

## KEY THEMES

- **MCP is ubiquitous but controversial** — every major platform ships one, but context cost sparks "right abstraction?" debate
- **Consumer-facing MCPs win biggest** — travel (1,662 bookmarks!), trading (628 likes), flights — not dev tools
- **"Code mode" is the emerging pattern** — Cloudflare's 2-tool approach may become the template
- **OpenClaw is the default AI workstation** — mentioned in nearly every MCP launch
