## OpenClaw vs Manus AI

| Dimension | OpenClaw | Manus AI |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Architecture | Self-hosted, open-source | Cloud-hosted (Meta) |
| Pricing | Free + API costs ($5-50/mo) | $20-200/mo (credit-based) |
| Privacy | Data stays local | Processes through Meta's cloud |
| Ease of setup | CLI, API keys, hosting | Sign up and delegate |
| Customization | Infinite (1,700+ skills) | Platform-defined tools |
| Best for | Building agents, internal ops | Delegating tasks, customer-facing |

## OpenClaw vs Claude Code / Cursor / Windsurf

| Tool | Type | Price | Key Strength |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| OpenClaw | General-purpose agent | Free + API | Most extensible, 24/7, messaging apps |
| Claude Code | CLI coding agent | $20/mo Pro + API | Best Claude integration, security |
| Cursor | AI-native IDE | $20-40/mo | Best UX for interactive editing |
| Windsurf | Team-oriented IDE | $0-15/mo | Multi-file Cascade editing |

**The Reorx perspective:** "Claude Code let me write code faster, but I was still the operator. OpenClaw let me become a manager. I can handle entire projects through chatting on my phone."

**Key distinction:** Claude Code/Cursor are coding assistants within dev environments. OpenClaw is a general-purpose agent accessible via messaging apps, running 24/7 with persistent memory.

## OpenClaw vs n8n / Zapier / Make

**Fundamental difference:** Agentic (OpenClaw) vs deterministic (n8n/Zapier/Make).

- **n8n:** Visual workflow builder, 400+ integrations, SOC2. AI is an add-on.
- **OpenClaw:** AI-native, every interaction starts with LLM reasoning. Handles fuzzy, open-ended requests. Not deterministic.
- **Combined approach popular:** n8n for backend deterministic workflows + OpenClaw as conversational front-end.

## OpenClaw vs AutoGPT / CrewAI

| Framework | Best For | Setup Time | Key Weakness |
|-----------|----------|------------|-------------|
| OpenClaw | Personal automation, messaging | 10 min | Security, context bloat |
| AutoGPT | Open-ended problem-solving | 20-30 min | Feedback loops, unreliable |
| CrewAI | Multi-agent pipelines | 20 min | Python-only, no messaging |

**Key quote:** "If OpenClaw is a finished robot servant, LangChain/CrewAI is a box of robot parts and a manual."

## Self-Hosted vs Cloud-Hosted

- Below ~100K requests/month → cloud cheaper
- Above 300K → self-hosting wins significantly
- Compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2) → self-hosted wins
- Hybrid is the norm: cloud APIs → self-hosted for sensitive workloads

## Pricing Comparison

| Platform | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-------------|
| OpenClaw (personal) | $0-10 |
| OpenClaw (small biz) | $20-40 |
| OpenClaw (heavy) | $100-800+ |
| Manus AI | $20-200 |
| Claude Code | $20 + API |
| Cursor | $20-40 |
| n8n | Free-$600 |
| Lindy | From $49 |
| ChatGPT Plus | $20-200 |
