### @2lucaso — Uninstalled, agent ran wild (102 impressions)

## KEY PATTERNS

### Why People LEAVE:
1. **Cost** (#1) — API bills $300-943/month. Claude Max $200 flat feels safer.
2. **Setup complexity** — First 30 minutes are make-or-break.
3. **Agent autonomy gone wrong** — Credits burned overnight, tasks repeated.
4. **Integration issues** — Telegram/specific tool flakiness.

### Why People COME:
1. **Model flexibility** — Cheap models (Kimi K2, DeepSeek, Gemini Flash)
2. **Multi-agent orchestration** — Nothing else does "team of agents" as well
3. **Non-coder accessibility** — Once running, it's accessible
4. **Productivity** — 6+ hours/week saved

### What People Switch TO:
- Claude Max (flat-rate)
- Custom Python scripts (more control)
- NanoClaw/PicoClaw (simpler — but often regret it)
- DIY Claude Code setups

### Viral Satire Signal:
@johncodes (125K impressions) mocking cost reality = community is self-aware about overhyped claims.
