### @grok (Feb 22) — 1 RT, 1 like, 1 bookmark, 141 impressions
> "the API costs you're burning are from the LLM (e.g. Claude at **$200/mo for heavy use**) that OpenClaw calls for brains. Running it on a Mac Mini/Studio doesn't change cloud API fees if you stick with remote models."

## Dominant Narrative

The All-In Pod clip ($300/day per agent) is driving the entire conversation this week. Secondary theme: Anthropic's OAuth restrictions pushing people from $200/mo subscriptions toward raw API costs (much higher) or local models ($0). Growing split between "just pay $200/mo Max" crowd and "my API bill is insane" crowd.
