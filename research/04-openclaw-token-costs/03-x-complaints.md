# X (Twitter) Research: OpenClaw Cost Complaints & Pain Points

## Summary

Zero tweets found about OpenClaw-the-product's own pricing. The entire conversation is about **the cost of running OpenClaw** — meaning API token costs from upstream providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google). This is the real pain point.

## 🔥 HIGH-ENGAGEMENT TWEETS

### @KanikaBK — "2.54 BILLION tokens spent" (58 RT, 346 likes, 712 bookmarks, 30.7K impressions)
> "MATTHEW BERMAN just dropped the most insane OpenClaw tutorial. 2.54 BILLION tokens spent perfecting 21 use cases. From meeting notes to full CRM systems to security councils."

**Insight:** The sheer scale of token consumption — 2.54B tokens for tutorials — creates sticker shock.

### @hasan28d — "Watching token costs burn with every mistake" (42 RT, 72 likes, 22 bookmarks, 22.1K impressions)
> "Everyone's busy flexing OpenClaw. Terminal installs. API keys. Debug loops. Watching token costs burn with every mistake. Meanwhile? I'm closing clients using Claude + MCP Connectors + Gamma — no setup drama."

**Insight:** Framing OpenClaw as expensive high-maintenance option vs simpler alternatives. "Token costs burn" is the core sentiment.

### @HelloBenWhite — "$650 Mac Mini + $1,250 Credits" (13 RT, 53 likes, 1.3K impressions)
> "Have been building @ThatAmberVibe, my @openclaw agent for three weeks. - $650 Mac Mini - $1,250 Credits + $4,000 $AmberVibe fees + $ x,xxx revenue launches this week."

**Insight:** Real numbers — $1,250 in API credits in 3 weeks, plus $650 hardware = ~$1,900 startup cost. Claims already profitable.

## 💰 COST-SPECIFIC PAIN POINTS

### @ForexDog1968 — "API billing exceeded ¥100K/month (~$670/mo)" (2 likes, 5 bookmarks, 348 impressions)
> "最近、Open ClawでClaude使ってたんだけどAPI課金がエグすぎて（月10万超えそう）心折れたんで ChatGPTのサブスクに切り替えた"
> Translation: "Using Claude with Open Claw, the API billing was so brutal (about to exceed ¥100K/month) it broke my spirit, so I switched to ChatGPT subscription"

**Insight:** Real user switching Claude API → ChatGPT subscription because costs hit ~$670+/month. "心折れた" = "broke my spirit."

### @theflickvault — "Burning through credits all the time" (27 impressions)
> "Currently using OpenClaw with 2 Claude Max Accounts and a GPT and Gemini basic account and still is burning through the credits all the time (building a telecom system)"

**Insight:** Running MULTIPLE subscription accounts simultaneously and still burning through credits. Enterprise-scale usage.

### @platonicspace — "Costs money to run on an API basis" (6 impressions)
> "openclaw is great but it costs money to run on an api basis with a good enough model. until the cost is figured out..."

### @wwiraash — Direct question (1 like, 13 impressions)
> "Everyone using Codex or Claude Code or OpenClaw. Just curious, how much money are you spending monthly on API tokens?"

**Insight:** People are actively asking each other what they spend. Cost is the #1 question.

## 🚫 SUBSCRIPTION / OAUTH DRAMA

### @TechNTech42 — "Avoiding true cost" (1 bookmark, 53 impressions)
> "People are using workarounds to avoid paying for the true cost of AI tokens (API cost) for running Open Claw 24x7 instead of making responsible use of AI tokens."

### @bitale14 — "Paid Gemini subscription, got banned" (169 impressions)
> "yesterday i have paid my gemini subscription for my openclaw, then i saw on X a lot of people complain that their account get banned because Google doesn't want you to login openclaw through Oauth, fuck my life, money spent for nothing!"

### @iamerickdamon — "Does Anthropic support auth via subscription?" (122 impressions)
> "Genuine question, does Anthropic actually support auth via subscription plans or not? OpenClaw docs says we can do so, but Anthropic docs says it's not allowed for third-party products."

**Insight:** The subscription-via-OAuth approach is in a gray area, causing confusion and wasted money.

## 📊 ENGAGEMENT PATTERNS

### @AlexFinn — Highest engagement cost opinion (507 impressions, 6 likes, 3 bookmarks)
> "Any AI company that turns off support for OpenClaw will be digging their own grave. I have never seen so many non native AI users adopt a tool and sign up for AI subscriptions ever. You're going to alienate them and dictate how they use their tokens? Massive mistake"

**Insight:** Users feel entitled to use subscriptions however they want. Provider crackdowns are generating backlash.
