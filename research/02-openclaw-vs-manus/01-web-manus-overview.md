# Web Research: What Is Manus AI

## Overview
- **Manus** (Latin for "hand") — autonomous general-purpose AI agent
- Built by **Butterfly Effect Pte. Ltd.** (branded "Monica"), registered in Singapore, originally Chinese-founded
- **Acquired by Meta for ~$2B in December 2025**
- Now integrated directly into Meta Ads Manager and available via Telegram/Messenger
- Tagline: "Think of Manus AI as a virtual colleague with its own computer"

## Key Stats
- Hit $125M ARR in 8 months (pre-acquisition)
- $0 to $100M ARR in eight months
- GAIA benchmark: 86.5% (state-of-art for autonomous agents)
- Uses Claude Sonnet + Qwen fine-tuned models internally

## Post-Acquisition Integration
- Native in Meta Ads Manager (rolled out Feb 2026)
- Autonomous capabilities: audience research, campaign analysis, performance optimization
- Available via Telegram (Manus Agents) — personal AI via messaging
- Plans for: WhatsApp, LINE, Slack, Discord, native Windows/Mac apps, direct computer control

## Pricing
- **Free plan**: 300-500 daily credits (~1-2 simple tasks/day), some report 1,200 credits
- **Plus**: $39/mo
- **Max**: $199/mo
- **Pro**: $499/mo (from Kanerika comparison)
- A single complex task can burn 900+ credits
- Credit burn rate widely criticized ("credit roulette")

## Strengths
- Zero-setup, cloud-based — no local install, no API wiring
- Browser automation (opens browser, searches, compares, cross-references)
- "Fulfills 90% of what everyone wants to accomplish with OpenClaw" (@PSkinnerTech)
- Telegram/Messenger distribution — meets users where they are
- Autonomous task execution — "assign and walk away"

## Weaknesses
- Credits run out mid-task with no recovery
- Privacy concerns — data flows through Meta infrastructure
- Manus knew a user's home address without being told (@dazzBuilds)
- Ads advice quality is generic ("basically a Meta rep" — @BishalKat2222)
- Captchas/blocking from data center IPs
- "Worse app at the end of the day than I started with" (Reddit)
- "Most overhyped scammy AI platform" (r/AI_Agents thread)
- Tasks get stuck in loops, burning 13K+ credits with no recovery
- No accurate knowledgebase management system
