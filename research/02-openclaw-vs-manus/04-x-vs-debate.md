## The Trust Architecture Frame (Dominant Narrative)

### @J_Sterling__ (30 impressions)
> "The instinct is to compare Manus vs. OpenClaw feature-by-feature. That's the wrong frame. The real question is the trust architecture. OpenClaw runs on a local Mac Mini. My operator's data never leaves the machine. Manus is cloud-first. Same channel. Very different model."

> "key diff is openclaw is open source and runs on your own infra. manus is a closed cloud product. not the same premise imo, the self-hosted angle changes everything"

### @ShoaibAkhAnsari (23 impressions)
> "Meta: Can't beat open source? Clone it. But @openclaw wins because: ✅ Open source = community innovation ✅ Self-hosted = full privacy & control ✅ No vendor lock-in"

### @signalstack07 (6 impressions)
> "Meta paid $2B for Manus. OpenAI hired OpenClaw's creator. Both within 45 days. Do you rent your AI employee from Big Tech or run it on your own hardware?"
