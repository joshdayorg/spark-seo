## 📊 KEY PATTERNS

### Common First-Time Frustrations:
1. **OAuth setup** — named repeatedly as specific wall
2. **"3 hours" meme** — multiple references to multi-hour setup; competitors using this as selling point
3. **VPS/browsing doesn't work** — users on EC2/VPS hit walls, end up buying Mac Minis
4. **Update breakage** — "OpenClaw doctor failed" after updates
5. **Agents don't work out of the box** — gap between install and useful requires significant config

### "Aha Moment" Stories:
1. Adding first skill = "The Matrix" feeling
2. Agent working while you're away = the magic moment
3. Building something that replaces paid software
4. Total beginner shipping a real product (GymBot)

### What Non-Technical Users Actually Build:
- Landing page design
- Event production management
- Fitness coaching agent
- Ecommerce data pipelines
- Grocery lists and mom reminders (the universal joke that's also true)

### The Emotional Journey:
**Hype → Confusion → Frustration → Breakthrough → Addiction (or Abandonment)**
