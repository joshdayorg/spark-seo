## 🔑 Engagement Patterns

| Signal | What Works |
|--------|-----------|
| **Aspirational money hooks** | "$600K in 14 days", "million dollar business" go mega-viral even as bait |
| **Contrarian takes** | "No Mac Mini needed", "Stop flexing OpenClaw" get attention |
| **Security angle** | 2 security threads in top 10, people scared of giving agents real access |
| **"Total beginner" framing** | Relatable > expert |
| **Bookmarks >> Likes** | 3-10x more bookmarks than likes — people saving tutorials |
| **Specific numbers** | "12 agents", "4 phones", "$25 phone" — specificity sells |

## ❌ Content Gaps

- **No canonical "OpenClaw in 5 minutes" thread** — people asking for it
- **No widely-shared install walkthrough** — multiple reports of "failing miserably"
- **Token cost management** not covered in any popular thread
- **Matthew Berman is the only widely-recommended video** — huge gap for written alternatives
