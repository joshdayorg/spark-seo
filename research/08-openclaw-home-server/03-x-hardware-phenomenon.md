> "Bought a new Mac mini to properly tinker with claws over the weekend. The apple store person told me they are selling like hotcakes and everyone is confused :) I'm definitely a bit sus'd to run OpenClaw specifically - giving my private data/keys to 400K lines of vibe coded monster that is being actively attacked at scale is not very appealing at all. Already seeing reports of exposed instances, RCE vulnerabilities, supply chain poisoning, malicious or compromised skills..."

Key details:
- Called $599 M4 Mac Mini "a lot of bang for the buck"
- Got his "for breathing room for future - local models etc."
- Praised **NanoClaw** (~4,000 lines vs OpenClaw's 400K) — runs everything in containers, AI-driven config instead of config files
- This single tweet is THE catalyst for the "Mac Mini shortage" narrative

> "I spent $72,000 on 120 Mac Minis, and another $12,000 setting everything up for OpenClaw. I want to change the world, and I believe this ClawdBot setup can do that. Will keep you guys posted on how everything develops. So far I've used my agents to reply to three emails and..."

**Became a meme** — the punchline "120 Mac Minis to reply to three emails" went viral.

**@TheCryptoLif7** (Francis Dhun) — 502 impressions, Feb 22 (rebuttal):
> "I just watched someone spend $72,000 on 120 Mac Minis for their agent setup and post it like they'd solved the problem. They didn't. That's seventy two thousand dollars pointed at the wrong bottleneck. Your agent isn't failing because your machine is slow. It's failing because the model's context window is degrading on the API side."

**@pahudnet** (Pahud Hsieh, Taiwan) — 212 impressions:
> "Someone spent $72,000 on 120 Mac Minis plus $12,000 for OpenClaw setup — this extreme investment reflects a near-religious level of belief in the agent future."

## Key Narrative Threads

1. **Karpathy validated the hardware choice** while simultaneously questioning the software security — perfect tension for an article
2. **The shortage is real** — multiple independent reports from different cities/countries
3. **The $84K rack is the perfect "don't do this" example** — bottleneck is API, not hardware
4. **International phenomenon** — Japan (Mercari), Taiwan, global
5. **"You don't need a Mac Mini" counternarrative** is growing but hasn't stuck yet
