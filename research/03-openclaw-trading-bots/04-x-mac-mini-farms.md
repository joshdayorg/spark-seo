## Income Claims

### @HelloBenWhite — $4K from $1.9K invested in 3 weeks
- $650 Mac Mini + $1,250 credits → $4,000+ revenue
- Agent built its own website, updated its own SOUL.md
- Revenue appears to be from memecoin ($Amber), not product sales

## The Skeptics

### @itsdanreeves (93 impressions)
> "Top 5 things that never happened. If you buy a mac mini to run openclaw congrats on wasting money"

### @hatsunama (136 impressions)
> "people are selling Mac Mini boxes on eBay for $20. So people can front like they spent 10k on bots they have no idea what to do with"

### @nikitabier (267 RTs)
> "I need the most powerful Mac Mini in the world so OpenClaw can tell me I have an unread email from my mom"

### Korean dev @goni0326 — honest take
- Token consumption is "enormous" — crypto trading needs well-optimized infrastructure or token costs eat all gains

## Meme Parodies
- @Samooves: "I've purchased 69 mac mini's. How to make money with Open Claw?" (84 likes, 44 replies)
- @TaoOutsider: "What if, instead of buying a Mac Mini, I invested the same amount into a Bittensor subnet?"

## The Grift Layer
1. @mrjmetz: "ClawPacks" — 10 SOUL templates + skills for $29-49
2. @Clawmode: "You don't need a Mac mini to launch a Trading agent" — cloud alternative
3. Mac Mini Solana memecoin (@macminisolcto)
4. Empty Mac Mini boxes on eBay for $20 (confirmed)

## The Core Tension
**Hype is about hardware (Mac Minis as physical objects to photograph). Actual bottleneck is token costs (API credits to run 24/7). People spending $650+ on compute while underestimating $100+/month API costs that actually matter.**
